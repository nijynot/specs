Filecoin Spec
=============

*Living Standard, 18 March 2019*

**Abstract**

Filecoin is a distributed storage network, with shared state persisted to a blockchain.

**Introduction**

This is the official Filecoin protocol specification. It is a work in progress. While reading, if you notice any discrepancies, or issues, please open an issue on the [specs repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs).

This collection of pages specify the protocols comprising the Filecoin network. The goal of these specs is to provide sufficient detail that another implementation, written using only this document as reference, can be fully compatible with `go-filecoin` peers, but this is still a work in progress.
